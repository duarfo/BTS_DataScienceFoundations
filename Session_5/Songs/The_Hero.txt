ONE PUNCH!!

3... 2... 1...

Killshot!
I'm here for fun
I'm number one

(What are you saying?)

(Frustration!)

(No one can stop me!)

One punch! That's it!

I always win!

(Listen to me!)
(Victory again!)
Power... Get more power!

Last minute limit counting -
3... 2... 1...
HERO!
Don't wanna hear you calling out my name

I'm not here for fortune and fame
HERO!
Instead, I'll fight knowing nobody knows my name...
(Nobody knows who he is!)
My foes are closing in and covering the sky!

...But I won't turn my back tonight!
HERO!
I'll stay - until I taste the dirt of defeat someday...
Unleash my fist!
HERO!
3... 2... 1... Fight back!
Push on, prepared, fight fair and square
(Whats going on? All of my foes are gone)
Let justice last
No questions asked
(Give me the heart, to cut through the dark and win!)
Power! Get more Power!
Adrenaline is flowing through my brain
Power! Get more Power!
With discipline and every hour that I've trained
HERO!
The tallest mountain started as a stone
I once was weak but now I've grown

HERO!
I know, the weakness within is my greatest foe
Push on!
The mortal man I used to be has died
There's god's inside my fist tonight
HERO!

I'll stay until I taste the dirt of defeat someday
Unleash my fist!
HERO!
Unbreakable, Unyielding
Draw the future in my mind
No matter what the cost
At any day and any time
Hero day and night!
Soaring proud and high!
HERO!
Don't want to hear you calling out my name
I'm not here for fortune and fame
HERO!
Instead I'll fight knowing nobody knows my name
Push on!
The mortal man I used to be has died
There's god's inside my fist tonight
HERO!
I'll stay until I taste the dirt of defeat someday
Unleash my fist!
HERO!
HEROO!
AHH!
AHHH!
AHHHH!
AHHHHH!
I'm gonna be the strongest
HEROO!
